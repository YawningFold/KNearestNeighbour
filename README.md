# KNearestNeighbour
Machine Learning Model using K nearest neighbour 

Created a model with some value of k and found the accuracy.

Then found what the best value for k will be for the model and created a model with the same and found the accuracy.

As we have only a 1000 rows the accuracy is not that great but can use the same procedure to create a better model with more data.
